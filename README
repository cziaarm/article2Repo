Article 2 Repo Plugin for PKP-OJS software
by Rory McNicholl 

based on Ejme plugin

Test on ojs 2.3.5 only

Once installed using the OJS plugin installation interface you'll need to apply the patch like so:

Apply the patch article2Repo.patch by going to the directory in which ojs is installed (eg /path/to/docroot/ojs) and running

patch -p0 < plugins/generic/article2Repo.patch

if need be you can reverse the patch like so:

patch -R -p0 < plugins/generic/article2Repo.patch
